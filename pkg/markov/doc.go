/*
Package markov provides a robust, high-performance, database-backed toolkit
for creating, training, and using Markov chain models in Go.

It supports multiple models within a single SQLite database, offers advanced
text generation features like temperature and top-K sampling, and includes
a streaming API for real-time applications. The library is designed to be
both powerful for production use and easy for experimentation.

For a complete usage example, see the README.md file.
