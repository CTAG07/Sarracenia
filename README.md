A Go based anti-scraper tarpit inspired by Nepenthes.

The goal of Sarracenia is to create a hostile environment for web scrapers by generating endless, plausible-looking, and resource-intensive web pages, slowing down and polluting the data of automated crawlers.

## Project Status

This project is being built in three major phases:

- [x] **Markov Library**: A database-backed, minimal memory usage Markov chain library for text generation.
- [x] **Templating Library**: A system for generating randomized and dynamic HTML content using the Markov library.
- [ ] **Final Tarpit Application**: The main web server and monitoring tools.

## Components

Components within the `/pkg` directory are designed as standalone, reusable libraries. They have no specific dependencies on the Sarracenia application and can be imported into other projects.

### `pkg/markov` - Go Markov Library

The core text generation engine for this project is a standalone, high-performance library for training and using Markov chain models. It is feature-complete and includes a streaming API, database persistence, and advanced generation features.

### `pkg/templating` - Dynamic HTML Template Engine

This library is the rendering engine for Sarracenia. It takes the text generated by the Markov library and embeds it within complex, randomized HTML structures. It's designed to be filesystem-based for easy updates and includes a rich set of template functions to generate everything from nonsensical data and styled elements to resource-intensive client-side JavaScript.
